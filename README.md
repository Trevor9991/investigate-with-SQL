Investigate security events using SQL

Senario: 
I'm a security professional at a large organization. Part of my job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. I recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.
My task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

Step 1: Retrieve after hours failed login attempts
Step 2: Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
Step 3: Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
Step 4: Retrieve employees in Marketing
Step 5: Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales
Step 6: Retrieve all employees not in IT
Step 7: Finalize my document with summary
